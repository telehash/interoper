# Interoper

**Interoper** is a simple interop testing tool for Telehash. It uses docker under the hood and makes json reports.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have docker installed. (use boot2docker on OSX).
2. Download and install interoper.
3. Create a Dockerfile in your projects root. (See [Creating docker images](#creating-docker-images) and [Test Control Protocol](#test-control-protocol))
4. Run `interoper test`
5. Run `interoper help` to learn about the other commands.

## Test file format

Test files are Markdown files which start with an (indent formatted) code block of some JSON followed by a description of the test.

The JSON header can have the following entries:

* `"timeout"` defines the maximum runtime for a test. (examples: `"3ms"`, `"3s"`, `"3m"`, `"3h"`)
* `"containers"` defines container settings for the individual roles. It must be an object. Each entry can have the `"command"` entry.

```markdown
    {
      "timeout": "3m"
    }

# `net-link` Test basic link establishment.

## Scenario

The SUT must start an endpoint and write its keys and paths to `/shared/id_sut.json`.

The Driver must start an endpoint, load the keys and paths from `/shared/id_sut.json` and establish a link with the SUT. The driver must close the link after 2.5 minutes.

## Failure conditions

* The link fails to open (after 1 minute)
* The link breaks before it is closed.

## Success conditions

* The remains open for at least 2.5 minutes (It keeps the exchange open)
* The link closes cleanly
```

## Creating docker images

Interoper can work with any docker image as long as it has a `th-test` executable in its `PATH`.

The `th-test` executable should accept two arguments. The first is the name of the test that should be run and the second argument is the role the process should assume (ex. `th-test net-link driver` asks the `th-test` executable to run the `net-link` test as the `driver`).

`interoper test` will build the `Dockerfile` in the current directory and run all implementations against this image.

## Test Control Protocol

Test processes can use regular logging to save informational data. In addition to the regular logging processes can also send (and receive) JSON formatted events over STDOUT.

All process types must send a `{"ty":"ready"}` when they are ready with there setup and can start running the test. The Driver will then run its test and when it is done it sends the `{"ty":"done"}` command. When The Driver is done running the tests it must exit. When the driver exits all other processes will be killed.

### Event JSON structure

All events must have the following format.
```json5
{
  "id": 0,
  // integer; unique event id. (must be unique withing the process)

  "ty": "endpoint.new",
  // string;  type of the event.

  "in": {}
  // object;  info object. contains additional information on the event.
}
```

### Event Types

#### `"ready"`

Signals that the sending process is ready to start the test. No extra information must be send with this event.

#### `"done"`

Signals that the sending process is done running the test. No extra information must be send with this event.

#### `"exited"`

Signals that the sending process has exited. This event is emitted by interoper and should not be emitted by the processes.
